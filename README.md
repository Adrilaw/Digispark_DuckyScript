# Digispark_DuckyScript
This is a set of hand-written DigiSpark sketches for the Arduino IDE that utilize the DigiKeyboard.h library making the DigiSpark to act as a keyboard and execute a variety of actions. If you have found a USB Rubber Ducky scipt that you want to convert to a DigiSpark sketch, you can go to https://naheel.xyz/ducky2digi/ and your ducky script and convert it to digispark.

# Instructions
Configure the Arduino IDE for the DigiSpark using: https://digistump.com/wiki/digispark/tutorials/connecting or Seytonic's tutorial: https://youtu.be/fGmGBa-4cYQ. Then download one of scripts (sketches), open them with Arduino IDE, modify them if needed and upload them to the DigiSpark.
